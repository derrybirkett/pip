# Delivery Method

This sequence guides discovery → build → ship with clarity and small, verifiable steps.

## 1) Big Picture
- Problem statement: <who, what, why now>
- Vision: <north star outcome>
- Success metrics: <activation, retention, NPS, revenue>
- Constraints & risks: <compliance, timeline, dependencies>

## 2) Data Models
- Entities: <list entities>
- Attributes: <key fields per entity>
- Relationships: <ERD overview>
- Source of truth: <system ownership>
- Dummy data plan (initial): <how to seed & reset>

## 3) APIs
- Contracts: <request/response schemas>
- Endpoints: <REST/GraphQL list>
- Auth: <tokens, scopes, rate limits>
- Error model: <codes, messages>
- Versioning: <strategy>

## 4) UI
- Flows: <task → screen → success>
- Wireframes: <low-fi references>
- Components: <reusable primitives>
- Accessibility: <WCAG targets>
- Empty/loading/error states: <defined>

## Definition of Done (per increment)
- Business: outcome hypothesis defined & measured
- Product: flows documented, edge cases addressed
- Engineering: tests, telemetry, rollback plan
- Security: review completed for scope
- Documentation: changelog + activity log updated
