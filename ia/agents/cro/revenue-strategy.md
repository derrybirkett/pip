# CRO — Revenue Strategy

## Revenue Model Philosophy

### Product-Led Growth Foundation
- Free tier or trial to reduce friction
- Self-serve onboarding and activation
- Value demonstrated before asking for payment
- Usage-based or value-based pricing

### Hybrid Approach (when scaling)
- Product-led for SMB and mid-market
- Sales-assisted for enterprise
- Community-led for developer adoption
- Partner-led for ecosystem expansion

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Principles
- **Value-based**: Price to customer value, not cost
- **Transparent**: Clear pricing page, no hidden fees
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and predict costs
- **Scalable**: Grows with customer usage/value
- **Fair**: Align incentives between you and customer

### Tier Design Template
```

- Limits: [usage, features, seats, time]
- Goal: demonstrate core value
- Success: activation + aha moment

Starter/Pro
- Target: individuals and small teams
- Price range: $[X]-$[Y]/mo
- Key features: [core value + key capabilities]
- Support: self-serve with docs
- Success: sustained usage + early wins

Business/Team
- Target: growing teams and departments
- Price range: $[X]-$[Y]/mo or /user
- Key features: [collaboration + scale features]

Enterprise
- Target: large organizations with complex needs
- Price: custom, annual contracts

```

### Pricing Testing Approach
- Start with hypothesis based on customer research
- Test price points with cohorts (A/B test)
- Monitor impact on conversion, revenue, churn
- Iterate quarterly in early stages
- Grandfather existing customers during changes

## Experimentation Framework

### Test Ideas
- Pricing: price points, trial length, discounts

1. **Hypothesis**: "We believe [change] will [impact] because [reason]"
2. **Design**: A/B test setup, sample size, duration
3. **Run**: Monitor for statistical significance
4. **Analyze**: Impact on primary and secondary metrics
5. **Decide**: Roll out, iterate, or abandon
6. **Document**: Record learnings for future reference
