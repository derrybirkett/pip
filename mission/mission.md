# Mission

## Who It Serves
- Primary user: Developer bootstrapping new projects (web, mobile, API, services)
- Secondary users: AI agents assisting with development

## Problem We Solve
- Current pain: Every new project requires hours to set up the same infrastructure (Nx, Docker, Postgres, n8n)
- Lack of consistency across projects leads to maintenance overhead
- AI agents need clear documentation and scaffolding patterns

## Solution Overview
- Core value: Single repository for both documentation framework AND reusable project scaffolds
- Differentiators:
  - Agent-based governance docs + executable infrastructure patterns
  - One-command bootstrapping for any app type
  - Consistent patterns across all projects
  - "Apply once" philosophy - fragments copied, then owned by project

## Why It Matters (Vision & Outcomes)
- Vision: <north star outcome in 12–24 months>
- Outcomes: <top 3 measurable outcomes>
- Success metrics: <quantified targets and leading indicators>

## Non‑Goals
- <Explicitly list what we are not doing>

## Current Status
- Lifecycle stage: <discovery | build | beta | GA>
- Next milestone: <date, objective>
