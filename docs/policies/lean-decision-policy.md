# Lean Decision Policy

Principles to align decisions with mission while reducing waste.

## Principles
- Hypothesis-driven work: state assumptions and measurable outcomes.
- Small batches: ship the smallest verifiable change.
- Short cycles: optimize for fast feedback and learning.
- Limit WIP: focus for flow, reduce context switching.
- Visualize work: make status and blockers visible.

## Decision Checklist
- Does this directly advance the mission and current goals?
- What is the smallest step to learn/validate?
- What metric moves, and how will we measure it?
- What risks exist, and what guardrails mitigate them?

## Roles
- CEO: mission fit and prioritization.
- CPO: customer value and scope.
- CTO: feasibility, cost, sequencing.
- CISO: risk posture and controls.
