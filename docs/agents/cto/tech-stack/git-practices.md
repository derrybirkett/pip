# Git Practices

## Branching
- Default: trunk-based with short-lived feature branches
- Naming: `feat/xyz`, `fix/bug-123`, `docs/area`, `chore/tooling`

## Commits
- Small, atomic commits with imperative subject
- Reference issues: `#123`

## Pull Requests
- Template includes: goal, scope, screenshots, test plan, risks
- Checklist: tests, docs, changelog, activity log updated
- Review: 1–2 reviewers; prefer async, avoid bikeshedding

## Releases
- Tags: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Change visibility: update `docs/changelog.md` and blog
