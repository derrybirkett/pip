# Product Overview

## What is .pip?

`.pip` (Project Intelligence & Process) is a lightweight documentation framework for AI-assisted development. It's a pure documentation repository with no application code.

## Core Value

Provides developers and AI agents with:
- Agent-based governance model (C-suite roles: CEO, CTO, CPO, CISO, CMO, CRO)
- Process templates for discovery, delivery, and collaboration
- Product graphs mapping key surfaces and flows
- Reusable project scaffolds (fragments) for bootstrapping new projects
- Consistent patterns across all projects

## Primary Users

- Developers bootstrapping new projects (web, mobile, API, services)
- AI agents assisting with development

## Key Differentiators

- "Apply once" philosophy - fragments are copied and owned by the project
- Single repository for both documentation framework AND executable infrastructure patterns
- One-command bootstrapping for any app type
- Clear decision rights and responsibilities per agent role

## Philosophy

Follows LEAN methodology:
- Small, validated steps
- Build-Measure-Learn cycles
- Minimize waste
- Validated learning over assumptions
- Continuous improvement (Kaizen)
